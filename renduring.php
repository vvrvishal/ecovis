                touch with Ecovis Sydney in November 2012 because they needed to establish their imprint quickly, before
                Christmas!

                                The key reasons or questions for which the client associated with us and
                                wanted us to completely focus were, How should Australia's presence be
                                manifested? Could they acquire bank loan capital for a commercial property
                                they had chosen for purchase while still being a start-up in Australia? How
                                quickly could all of this occur?

                                    and OSR within a few days.
