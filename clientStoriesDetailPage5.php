                                <p>We quickly identified the best structure for combining asset protection,
                                    tax efficiency (in terms of their UK/Australia interaction), and
                                    management of their new Australian business.</p>
                                <p> This included a main trading company, a secondary company to hold a
                                    primary production property, and a third company to hold the
                                    intellectual property that they expected to develop in Australia.</p>
                                <p> We had all three companies registered with ASIC (with David Conley as
                                    resident director for each) and registered for all necessary taxes with
                                    the ATO and OSR within a few days.</p>

                                <p>We ensured that any necessary agreements between the three entities
                                    and the UK parent were considered, in order to satisfy Australian/UK
                                    laws and potential transfer pricing issues, by referring them to a local
                                    commercial lawyer.</p>
                                <p>We ensured that the client was advised on options for potential
                                    secondments of UK employees to Australia to assist in the local
                                    operations through a referral to a local immigration agent, and we
                                    enabled the client to quickly determine the best fit for their needs
                                    through a referral to several banks, and they were able to purchase.</p>
